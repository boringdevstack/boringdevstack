# 🔐 Security Researcher

Hi — I'm a security researcher focused on **vulnerability research, secure code review, and software security analysis**. I work on identifying real-world security issues in applications, libraries, and systems, and documenting them in a way that helps developers build safer software.

My goal is to contribute to a stronger security ecosystem through **open research, responsible disclosure, and practical tooling**.
